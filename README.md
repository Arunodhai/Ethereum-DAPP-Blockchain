# Ethereum based Decentralized Application (DApp) Project

## Overview
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to interact with the Sepolia Ethereum blockchain. Users can send messages to the blockchain by entering text into a textbox and clicking the "Set" button. Additionally, they can retrieve messages from the blockchain by clicking the "Get" button. The project utilizes React for the frontend, and Express and Node.js for the backend. Infura serves as the provider for interfacing with the Sepolia Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the DApp locally:

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend: `npm install`

### Configuration
1. Obtain an Infura API key: [Infura](https://infura.io/)
2. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your Infura API key to the `.env` file: `INFURA_API_KEY=your-api-key`

### Running the DApp
1. Start the backend server: `npm run start-server` in the `backend` directory.
2. Start the React app: `npm start` in the project's root directory.
3. Access the DApp in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
